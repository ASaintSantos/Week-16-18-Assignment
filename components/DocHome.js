        <p>The question that is labeled as the above Title, <br></br>was the exact question asked on the birthday<br></br> of The Church. Peter and the other 11 Apostles<br></br> had just been filled with The Holy Ghost as promised<br></br> to them by The Lord Jesus Christ. The evidence<br></br> that they had The Holy Spirit was the people from<br></br> different regions that had gathered that day on<br></br> Pentecost had heard Peter and the others speaking<br></br> in tongues as The Holy Spirit gave them the utterance. <br></br>This language was not a learned dialect, but it was <br></br>produced by the very Spirit of God that now dwelt<br></br> within them. Peter than began to share The Gospel <br></br>"The Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ" <br></br>to those from the surrounding regions that came<br></br> to celebrate Pentecost or the feast of weeks "Shavout" <br></br>that was a celebration of Moses receiving the Ten<br></br> Commandments instituting The Torah "The Law".<br></br> The famous question was then asked "Men and<br></br> brethren, what shall we do?" Peter standing up with<br></br> the other 11 Apostles "then said unto them.<br></br> Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the<br></br> name of Jesus Christ for the  remission of sins,<br></br> and ye shall recieve the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br></br> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, <br></br>and to all that are afar off, even as many as<br></br> the Lord our God shall call."<br></br><br></br> - Acts 2:37-39 - <br></br><br></br><br></br>This was the beginning of the Christian Church<br></br> and is known as the Birthday of the Church.<br></br> The commandment that Peter gave for Salvation<br></br> is the same today. <br></br><br></br>WE MIRROR CHRIST'S <br></br>DEATH, BURIAL AND RESURRECTION<br></br> BY REPENTING OF OUR SINS AND DYING TO OUR SELF<br></br> WILL, THEN WE APPLY THE BURIAL THROUGH<br></br> THE WATERS OF BAPTISM IN JESUS NAME FOR<br></br> THE REMISSION OR REMOVAL OF OUR SINS<br></br> AND THEN WE ARE FILLED WITH THE GIFT OF<br></br> THE HOLY GHOST-EVIDENCED THE SAME AS<br></br> THE APOSTLES' BY SPEAKING IN OTHER TONGUES<br></br> AS THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVES THE UTTERANCE. <br></br><br></br> - Acts 2:4 - </p>
